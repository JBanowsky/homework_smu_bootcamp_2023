    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data, the district had a failing overall grade of 65.17% (this is with the normally grading metric of a 70% as passing). This data is misleading when divided into school type. It is my conclusion that the charter schools in the district are doing exceptionally well while the district schools are doing very poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an overall comparison of 90.43% passing rate for charter schools to a 53.67% passing rate for district schools, the district has a large bias towards charter schools. The top 5 best performing schools are charter schools while the bottom 5 schools are district schools. When looking into it further, the lowest overall average grade for charter schools is 89.23% while the highest district school overall grade was 54.64%. \n",
    "\n",
    "In attempting to analyze further differences between grade performance in schools, there is not enough data to determine anything beyond the difference of type. Student grade level does not seem to be a factor given that the grade level scores at each school is within +1 or -1 of the school average. Schools with smaller populations have better scores, but every charter school has fewer students than every district school. Furthermore, you might also conclude that the smaller budget per student means higher grades except for the fact that all but one of the charter schools has a smaller budget than district schools. Of the district schools that have a smaller budget than the one charter school, one has the highest overall grade and the other has the lowest. When looking at the school types individually, there is no obvious pattern between size of student population or budget per student compared to grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "My conclusion is that a student in a charter school has a drastically better chance of passing math and reading than in the district schools and that there should be further research into the differences based on class size, course level, feeder middle schools, and student demographics to help better understand the differences in charter and district school performance."
